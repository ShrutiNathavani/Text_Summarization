## OverView:

Text summarization is a challenging task that can be time-consuming and difficult for humans to perform, particularly when dealing with large amounts of text.
To address this challenge, our project uses natural language processing techniques to automate the summarization process and generate accurate and concise summaries.

In this project, we used a range of preprocessing techniques, including text cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
These techniques helped us to prepare the input text for summarization and improve the accuracy of our summarization algorithm.

In addition to the preprocessing methodology, results, analysis, and future work, our summarization tool allows users to input text in three different ways: 
text entries, URLs, and PDF documents. 

This makes our tool versatile and accessible to users who may have different types of input data.

## Results and Analysis

Our results showed that our summarization tool performed well, generating summaries that captured the key points of the input text with a high degree of accuracy. We also analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of our summarization tool and discussed potential areas for future work.

## Future Work

We believe that our summarization tool can be further improved by incorporating more advanced natural language processing techniques, such as deep learning algorithms and attention mechanisms.
