# Text_Summarization

The input text can be in the form of a text entry, URL, or a PDF document. 

## Results and Analysis

Our results showed that our summarization tool performed well, generating summaries that captured the key points of the input text with a high degree of accuracy. We also analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of our summarization tool and discussed potential areas for future work.

## Future Work

We believe that our summarization tool can be further improved by incorporating more advanced natural language processing techniques, such as deep learning algorithms and attention mechanisms.
